# zmk-input-processor-threshold

A [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) input processor that filters pointing device output until enough movement has accumulated to confirm intentional input. Accidental contact — a finger resting on or brushing the device — is silently discarded. Once the accumulated movement crosses the threshold, normal output resumes until the device goes idle.

## `<keyboard>.conf`

```ini
CONFIG_ZMK_POINTING=y
CONFIG_ZMK_INPUT_PROCESSOR_THRESHOLD=y
```

## Usage

Add the following to your `<keyboard>.overlay` or `<keyboard>.dtsi`:

```c
#include <input/processors/threshold.dtsi>

/ {
    pointing_device_listener {
        compatible = "zmk,input-listener";
        device = <&pointing_device>;
        input-processors = <&threshold 100 2000>;
    };
};
```

Replace `pointing_device_listener` and `&pointing_device` with your actual listener and device labels (e.g. `trackball_listener` and `&trackball`). If your board or shield already defines an input-listener node, reference it instead of creating a new one:

```c
&defined_listener_label {
    input-processors = <&threshold 100 2000>;
};
```

`<&threshold param1 param2>`

**`param1` — threshold (raw sensor counts)**

The values below are calculated and may not reflect real-world sensor behavior. Use them as a starting point and adjust to feel.

| Sensor CPI | 15° turn (34mm ball) | 5 mm (trackpad) |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | 70 | 79 |
| 600 | 105 | 118 |
| 800 | 140 | 157 |
| 1200 | 210 | 236 |
| 1600 | 280 | 315 |

**`param2` — idle-ms**

How long (in milliseconds) the device must be still before the filter resets. If the filter resets while you are still moving, increase it. If accidental touches are not filtered after lifting your hand, decrease it.

## Chaining with other processors

Place `threshold` first. Processors after it only receive events once intentional movement is confirmed — accidental contact is silently dropped before it reaches them.

If you need a processor to activate on any touch regardless of the threshold filter, place it before `threshold`.

```c
input-processors = <
    // processors here see all events, including accidental contact
    &threshold 100 2000
    // processors here only see intentional movement
>;
```

A common setup with `zip_temp_layer`, where layer 2 is a mouse click layer that activates only during intentional movement:

```c
input-processors = <
    &threshold 100 2000
    &zip_temp_layer 2 2000
    &zip_xy_scaler 1 2
>;
```

## How it works

Every REL X/Y input event increments an internal accumulator by `|value|`. While the accumulator is below the threshold, all events are blocked. Once the threshold is crossed, events flow through normally. After the device is idle for `idle-ms` milliseconds, the accumulator resets and filtering resumes.
